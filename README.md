#### SUMMARY

<p align="justify">
  <i>
    Diabetes Mellitus (Diabetes) is a chronic disease, which when
untreated can culminate in a certain period of time, various types of
symptoms like ketoacidosis, polydipsia, polyphagia or even death. The
best known methods for detecting disease are slow but safe, as in the case
of the Oral to Glucose Test or Fasting Glycemic Test, or fast but
uncertain, such as the Glycemic Test (MILICH, 2014).
This is one of the biggest barriers of those who carry the disease,
prior detection and rapid, because depending on the stage of the disease,
the disease has no symptoms and if not receive the treatment, the disease
may become worse and may become incurable.
Artificial Intelligence methods were applied, such as the Apriori
association rules mining algorithm and Support Vector Machines
supervised learning, to identify who has or not the disease in data set Pima
Indians, in the same way as the Viera, Parreira and Silveira research,
which they used at the time the technic Perceptron, but with greater speed
and degree of precision, also allowing the patient to obtain the prognosis
in an unconventional way.
 The results of the SVM with 79.20% accuracy, 0.50% higher
compared to the work of Vieira, Parreira and Silveira were obtained in
this work.
